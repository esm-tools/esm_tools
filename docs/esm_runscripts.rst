ESM Runscripts
==============


Running a Model/Setup
---------------------

`ESM-Runscripts` is the `ESM-Tools` package that allows the user to run the experiments.
`ESM-Runscripts` reads the runscript (either a `bash` or `yaml` file), applies the
required changes to the namelists and configuration files, submits the runs of the
experiment to the compute nodes, and handles and organizes restart, output and log files.
The command to run a runscript is::

    esm_runscripts <runscript.yaml/.run> -e <experiment_ID>

The ``runscript.yaml/.run`` should contain all the information regarding the experiment
paths, and particular configurations of the experiment (see the :ref:`yaml:Runscripts` section
for more information about the syntax of `yaml` runscripts). The ``experiment_ID`` is used
to identify the experiment in the scheduler and to name the experiment's directory (see
:ref:`esm_runscripts:Experiment Directory Structure`).

`ESM-Runscript` allows to run an experiment check by adding the ``-c`` flag to the previous
command. This check performs all the system operations related to the experiment that would
take place on a normal run (creates the experiment directory and subdirectories, copies the
binaries and the necessary restart/forcing files, edits the namelists, ...) but stops before
submitting the run to the compute nodes. We strongly recommend **running first a check before
submitting an experiment to the compute nodes**, as the check outputs contains already valuable
information to understand whether the experiment will work correctly or not (we strongly
encourage users to pay particular attention to the `Namelists` and the `Missing files` sections
of the check's output).

Job Phases
----------

The following table summarizes the job phases of `ESM-Runscripts` and gives a brief description.
...

Running only part of a job
--------------------------

It's possible to run only part of a job. This is particularly interesting for
development work; when you might only want to test a specific phase without
having to run a whole simulation.

As an example; let's say you only want to run the ``tidy`` phase of a
particular job; which will move things from the particular run folder to the
overall experiment tree. In this example; the experiment will be called ``test001``::

        $ esm_runscripts ${PATH_TO_USER_CONFIG} -t tidy_and_resubmit

Experiment Directory Structure
------------------------------

All the files related to a given experiment are saved in the `Experiment Directory`. This includes
among others model binaries, libraries, namelists, configuration files, outputs, restarts, etc.
The idea behind this approach is that all the necessary files for running an experiment are
contained in this folder (the user can always control through the runscript or configuration files
whether the large forcing and mesh files also go into this folder), so that the
experiment can be reproduced again, for example, even if there were changes into one of the
model's binaries or in the original runscript.

The path of the `Experiment Directory` is composed by the ``general.base_dir`` path specified in the
runscript (see :ref:`yaml:Runscripts` syntax) followed by the given ``experiment_ID`` during the
``esm_runscripts`` call::

    <general.base_dir>/<experiment_ID>

The main experiment folder contains the subfolders indicated in the table below. Each of these
subfolders contains a folder for each component in the experiment (i.e. for an AWI-CM experiment the
``outdata`` folder will contain the subfolders ``echam``, ``fesom``, ``hdmodel``, ``jsbach``,
``oasis3mct``).

======================= ======================= ========================================================

If one file was to be copied in a directory containing a file with the same name,
both files get renamed by the addition of their start date and end dates at the
end of their names (i.e. ``fesom.clock_YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD``).

The structure of the ``run_YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD`` directory replicates that of the general
experiment folder. `Run` directories are created before each new run and they are
useful to debug and restart experiments that have crashed.

.. Note::
   Having a `general` and several `run` subfolders means that files are duplicated and, when
   models consist of several runs, the `general` directory can end up looking very untidy.
   `Run` folders were created with the idea that they will be deleted once all files
   have been transferred to their respective folders in the `general` experiment directory.
   Currently, that is not the case due to potential issues when there is a need for
   restarting a crashed simulation: a faulty tidy-up (i.e. due to a run crash, some run
   files are updated but others not) will lead to a faulty restart. In the the near
   future the user will have control on whether keeping the `run` folders or deleting them,
   through a variable in the runscript.

Debugging an Experiment
-----------------------

To debug an experiment we recommend checking the following files that you will find, either
in the `general` experiment directory or in the `run` subdirectory:

  * The `ESM-Tools` variable space file ``config/<experiment_ID>_finished_config.yaml``.
  * The run log file ``run_YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD/<experiment_ID>_compute_YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD_<JobID>.log```.
