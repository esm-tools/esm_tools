Note: 
The master branch experiments yaml scripts follow the latest developments of FESOM2 and OpenIFS.
New commits may come in multiple times a day. These scripts are not tested in any way shape of form. 
Use these if you wish to test-drive the latest master branch changes. 

For scientific work it is recommended you stick to v3.1.
