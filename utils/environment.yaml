# ENVIRONMENT FOR RUNNING ESM-TOOLS WITH CONDA
# ============================================
# WARNING: Running ESM-Tools with conda is not recommended at this state,
# and we won't be offering support for that. This environment and instructions
# are put together only for testing purposes, for the core team.
#
# How to install esm_tools using a conda environment
# --------------------------------------------------
# 1. ``conda env create -f utils/environment.yaml -n esm_tools``
# 2. Clone ESM-Tools from the github repository and use the ``./install.sh`` script
#    (that script uses pip, because ESM-Tools is not in a conda repository, however
#    most of the important dependencies for ESM-Tools are already defined in this
#    file, meaning that pip almost only installs ESM-Tools).
