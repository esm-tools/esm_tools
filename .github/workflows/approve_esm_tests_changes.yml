# ESM-Tools pre-merge automation
# ==============================
# In a pull-request, if a comment contains #bump, the following steps are triggered:
#   1. merges `release` into the PR-branch (updates bumpversion values and makes sure whatever we tag in the next step has everything until that version number)
#   2. bumps the version according to the PR-branch name (`hotfix/`, `fix/` , `feature/` and `feat/` are understood)
#   3. merges PR-branch into `develop`
