"""
When run from either the command line or in library mode (note **not** as an
ESM Plugin), ``esm_archiving`` can be configured to how it looks for specific
files. The configuration file is called ``esm_archiving_config``, should be
written in YAML, and have the following format::

    echam:  # The model name
        archive: # archive seperator **required**
            # Frequency specification (how often
            # a datestamp is generated to look for)
            frequency: "1M"
            # Date format specification
            date_format: "%Y%m"


By default, ``esm_archive`` looks in the following locations:

    1. Current working directory
    2. Any files in the XDG Standard:
        https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html


If nothing is found, the program reverts to the hard-coded defaults, found in
``esm_archiving/esm_archiving/config.py``

.. note::

    In future, it might be changed that the program will look for an experiment
    specific configuration based upon the path it is given during the
    ``create`` or ``upload`` step.

Generating a configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the command line switches ``--write_local_config`` and
``--write_config`` to generate configuration files either in the current
working directory, or in the global directory for your user account defined by
the XDG standard (typically ~/.config/esm_archiving)::

    $ esm_archive --write_local_config
    Writing local (experiment) configuration...

    $ esm_archive --write_config
    Writing global (user) configuration...
