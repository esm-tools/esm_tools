# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI-Ollie

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ release, CI-Ollie ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ release, CI-Ollie ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "install as user"
  install_as_user:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    # To activate this sort of job for both ollie and mistral, we can do:
    # run-on ${{ matrix.supercomputers }}
    # strategy:
    #   matrix:
    #     supercomputers: ["ollie", "mistral"]
    runs-on: [self-hosted, ollie]
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
