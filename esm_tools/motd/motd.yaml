                This minor release include no new models or couple setups but new features to the following packages:
                    - esm_master
                    - esm_parser
                    - esm_environment

                    - esm_tools
                To get this updates simply run 'esm_versions upgrade'.

                NOTE TO DEVELOPERS AND ADVANCE USERS: if you intend to use an branch of 'esm_tools' that is not 'release'
                you might face conflicts with the new 'esm_environment'. These conflicts are easily solved by copying the
                new machine files into your 'esm_tools' branch (make sure you commit the changes in your branch before
                copying the machine files over). Feel free to contact us if you need any assistance with this issue.
