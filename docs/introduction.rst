This is the user manual for the esm-tools. To contribute to this document, please contact the authors for feedback.
    
The esm-tools are a collection of scripts to download, compile, configure different simulation models for the Earth system, such as atmosphere, ocean, geo-biochemistry, hydrology, sea-ice and ice-sheet models, as well as coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). They include functionality to write unified runscripts to carry out model simulations for different model setups (standalone and ESMs) on different HPC systems.
