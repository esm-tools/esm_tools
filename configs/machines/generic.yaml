                    You are trying to run an actual simulation with the environment from
                    ``configs/machines/generic.yaml``. This is not allowed, you should
                    always run using a specific machine file. The ``generic.yaml`` file
                    is only aimed for local testing of ESM-Tools functionalities and dry
                    check runs (``esm_runscripts -c``).\n

                    If you are running on an HPC and you're seeing this message, it's
                    likely that the HOSTNAME of your machine does not match the
                    pattern defined in ``configs/machines/all_machines.yaml``. Please,
                    check that your machine is included in that file and that the
                    ``configs/machines/<your_machine>.yaml`` exists.\n
